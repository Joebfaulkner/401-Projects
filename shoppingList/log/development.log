Precook the beef shank:\r\nTo the inner pot of the Instant Pot, add the beef shank, scallions, ginger, and star anise. Add enough water to reach the 4-quart mark, about 6 cups. Lock on the lid and make sure the valve is set to seal. \r\n\r\nPrecooking the beef shank will release the excess scum (the frothy foamy gray bits). This will also yield a cleaner and clearer broth in the end.\r\n\r\n2. Pressure cook and cool the beef shank:\r\nProgram the pressure cooker on the manual/pressure cooking setting for 10 minutes at high pressure. It will take several minutes for the Instant Pot to come up to pressure before the actual cook time begins.\r\n\r\nWhile the beef shank precooks, prepare an ice bath. \r\n\r\nOnce the cook time is up and the Instant Pot beeps, carefully quick release the pressure with the steam vent. \r\n\r\nRemove the beef shank using tongs and submerge it in the ice bath for 10 minutes. Discard the cooking water and rinse and dry the inner pot.\r\n\r\n3. Preheat the pot, slice the beef, and prepare the spices: \r\n\r\nReplace the inner pot and program the pressure cooker on the manual sauté setting at high temperature. Let preheat for 5 minutes and then add the oil.\r\n\r\nWhile the Instant Pot is preheating, place the beef shank on a cutting board with tapered ends pointing left and right. Slice into 1/2-inch pieces. \r\n\r\nAdd the star anise, ginger, and bay leaves to a spice ball or wrap them in cheesecloth and tie up the bundle with string. This will help contain the spices for easy removal at the end.\r\n\r\n4. Make the soup:\r\nTo the Instant Pot, add the dark soy sauce, soy sauce, toban djan, chili crisp, sugar, garlic, and white pepper. Stir until dissolved. Add the onions, tomatoes, and beef shank. \r\n\r\nAdd enough water to reach the 4-quart mark, about 7 cups.  \r\n\r\nLock on the lid and make sure the valve is set to seal. Program the pressure cooker on the manual setting for 1 hour and 20 minutes at high pressure.\r\n\r\n5.Cook the bok choy and noodles:\r\nWhen there is about 15 minutes left on the Instant Pot timer, fill a large pot 2/3 with water and bring to a boil. Add the bok choy and wheat noodles. Cook according to the noodle package instructions, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove and drain.\r\n\r\n6. Vent, remove the spice ball, and serve:\r\nOnce the pressure cooking time is up and the Instant Pot beeps, carefully quick release the pressure with the steam vent.\r\n\r\nRemove the lid and remove the spice ball or cheesecloth. Season with salt, to taste.\r\n\r\nAdd the noodles, bok choy, and soup to individual bowls. Garnish with scallions and cilantro, if using.\r\n\r\nThe soup will last in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. The noodles and bok choy should be cooked fresh or stored separately for up to a day. Use the Instant Pot “keep warm” function, the stovetop, or the microwave to reheat. "}, "commit"=>"Submit"}
